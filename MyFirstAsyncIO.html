          <h3>"My First Async I/O" </h3>
          <p>In the exercise "My First I/O", you hopefully realized how a synchronous method is a potential pitfall for a program. Is there a solution? Yes there is.  "My First Async I/O" introduces you to asynchronous calls. This is a crucial part of JavaScript, and a main contributor to why Node.js is so efficient as a server side solution.</p>
          <h4>Asynchronous?</h4>
          <p>Asynchronous execution means that other tasks can be accomplished while one (or more) task(s) completes. Let's see an analogy to make the difference between <strong>synchronous</strong> and <strong>asynchronous</strong> clear:<br/><em><strong>Synchronous:</strong> You want a pizza for dinner and you are out of the frozen kind. So you have to stop playing WOW which upsets your clan. You go to the kitchen, make the dough, cover it with sauce, add the cheese, and smother it your favorite bacon topping. You just spent 20 minutes of your time making the pizza with another 10 minutes in the oven. The timer beeps and you pull the hot pie out. You can sit back down in front of your computer, eat the pizza, and continue with your conquest.<br/><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> You want a pizza for dinner while playing WOW. You open up a browser window on your 5th monitor. You load up the Pizza website and order your extra cheesy bacon pizza with a side of bacon grease garlic sauce. You go back to your raid and after 20 minutes the door bell rings. You get the pizza. You sit back down in front of your computer, eat the pizza, and continue with your conquest.<br/>So what is the difference? One way you waste 20-30 minutes of precious WOW time, the other way you waste $20 plus tip.</em><br/>(From <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/14104/epascarello">epascarello</a> on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4559032/easy-to-understand-definition-of-asynchronous-event">Stack Overflow)</a></p>
          <p>In terms of this Learn You node exercise, using an asynchronous filestream operation means that you can work on the contents that have been read from the file as the rest of the file is being read. The method you use to asynchroneously read a file is <code>fs.readFile()</code> instead of the <code>fs.readFileSync()</code> method you called in the last exercise. Similarly though, the first parameter you send this method is the name of the file you would like to be read. However, there is a a second parameter as well. This parameter is a <strong>callback function</strong>:<br/><code>fs.readFile(fileName, callback)</code></p> 

          <h4>Callbacks</h4>
          <p>Callbacks are functions that you pass to a function as a parameter, and the calling function (the one with the callback as a parameter) will innvoke the callback function at some point by its descretion. Oftentimes in Node.js, the callback function takes two parameters: <strong>err</strong>, where it passes an error message, and <strong>data</strong>, where it passes valid data. This is how the callback function in <code>fs.readFile(fileName, callback)</code> is set up. So, it looks like:<br/><code>fs.readFile(fileName, callback(err,data))</code></p>
          <p>Sometimes, you have two callback parameters; one that handles errors and one that handles the data. The method/module will specify how the callbacks are set up, and you <em>must</em> conform.  Think of it like this, the module, such as the fs module has built-in methods, such as the readFile method. These methods have a definition (which we don't see) which sends error messages and valid data to the callback that the programmer provides. If you do not conform to the specifications it has set up, you will not be able to access this information, or you might also cause a runtime error.</p>
          <h4>When Is the Callback Invoked?</h4>
          <p>The callback is invoked when the function that has it as a parameter calls it. In the case of the <code>fs.readFile(fileName, callback)</code> method, it will invoke the callback when it is finished with reading the file, or when there is an error.</p>
          <h4>Callback Functions and Asynchronicity</h4>
          <p>Callback functions go hand in hand with asynchronicity.  Let's take the filestream method we are using for this exercise as an example. We can read the file, and within the callback function (which will be invoked after the file is read) we can manipulate the data into a readable string, splice it into an array using the newline as a delimiter, and print the number of newlines found in the file. Outside of the callback function and outside of the read file method, we can do other things. These other things will be run before the contents of the callback are invoked because of asynchronicity.</p>
          <h4>Putting It All Together</h4>
          <p>Putting this all together, the final code will look like this:</p>
          <pre><code>var fs = require('fs');<br/>fs.readFile(process.argv[2], function(err, data){<br/>     if (err) {<br/>          console.log(err);<br/>     }<br/>     var contentsString = data.toString();<br/>     var contentsArray = contentsString.split('\n');<br/>     var newLineCount = contentsArray.length - 1;<br/>     console.log(newLineCount);<br/>});<br/>//console.log("outside of readfile");</code></pre>
          <p>If you run the last line of the code (the commented out line), you will see that that prints before the number of newlines prints. This proves the asynchronicity of the program. Pretty cool, huh?</p>
